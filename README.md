# Naboul the Magic Robot

In this project, I combined my passion for robotics and magic to create **Naboul**, a robot that performs three interactive magic tricks. Naboul uses speech recognition to listen, speak, and engage with the audience, delivering a captivating experience. The project involved building the robot from scratch, designing its structure with materials like cardboard, wood, and metal hinges, and engineering magic mechanisms powered by sensors and actuators.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

├── ColorSensor_Code/ ├── CSV-files/ ├── HallEffect_Code/ ├── MCE project.docx ├── MCE project.pptx ├── SpeechRecognition_Code/ ├── Trick1_Code/ ├── Trick2_Code/ ├── Trick2_CodeTake2/ ├── Trick3_Code/ └── Trick3_Code_BasByezbat/


### Directory Overview:

- **ColorSensor_Code**: Code used for the color sensor involved in one of Naboul's tricks.
- **CSV-files**: Supporting data files used in the magic trick setup and testing.
- **HallEffect_Code**: Code responsible for controlling the magnetic sensor used in one of Naboul's tricks.
- **MCE project.docx**: Documentation of the project, including technical details and design explanations.
- **MCE project.pptx**: Presentation slides for showcasing the project.
- **SpeechRecognition_Code**: Code for integrating speech recognition functionality into Naboul.
- **Trick1_Code**, **Trick2_Code**, **Trick2_CodeTake2**, **Trick3_Code**, **Trick3_Code_BasByezbat**: Codebases for the magic tricks performed by Naboul.

## Magic Tricks

Naboul performs three distinct magic tricks, each involving different sensors and actuators. Below is a description of each trick along with a demonstration video:

1. **Cap of the Pencil Trick**
   - *Description*: Naboul executes a quick and impressive pencil cap trick using sleight-of-hand mechanics and clever timing.

2. **Disappearing Card Trick**
   - *Description*: Naboul asks the user to choose a card and then makes it disappear from a set of cards using a servo motor hidden under the table.

3. **Guess the Card Trick**
   - *Description*: Naboul uses a combination of a color sensor and a magnetic sensor to guess the user's card, assisted by human engineers.

## Technical Overview

- **Speech Recognition**: Naboul listens and responds to commands via a speech recognition system.
- **Actuators**: Servo motors and actuators are used to perform card switching, hiding mechanisms, and hand movements.
- **Sensors**: Naboul integrates both color and magnetic sensors to execute his tricks with precision.

## Build Process

The entire robot was built using simple materials such as cardboard, wood, and metal hinges. Naboul's structure is designed to support the integration of sensors and actuators, ensuring seamless trick execution.

- **Materials**: Cardboard, wood, metal hinges
- **Key Components**: Servo motors, sensors (color, magnetic), actuators

Naboul's magic tricks are a combination of engineering ingenuity and clever programming to create an interactive and entertaining experience for the audience.

## Future Enhancements

There are plans to enhance Naboul's capabilities by:
- Adding more sophisticated speech interaction
- Introducing new tricks with advanced mechanisms
- Improving the overall design for better audience engagement
